Naked_Beer is an web-based enterprise-strength marketing scheme with the following competences:
1. 	support, consultancy
2. 	business model innovation?
3. 	Brand recognition â€“ brewers ore likely to sign up given expertise but wont be used to market to customers.

## Naked_Beer Concept

The repository structure follows the concepts of Naked_Beer, which consists of five loosely coupled stages:

![Market Research] [marketresearch-image]

To briefly explain these five sub-systems:

* **Extreme Users** 
-What can the design bring?
-What are the opportunities offered by Unibrew global challenges
-Energy recycling
-Process control

* **Industry Research and Business Model** 
(a) protection
(b) value chain
(c) entrepreneurial strategy
(d) business model

* **Environmental and Social aspects** 

* **Analytics** are performed on the Naked_Beer events. Currently we have a set of recipes and cubes as SQL views for both Redshift and Postgres, and an online cookbook of ad hoc analyses that work with Redshift, Postgres and Hive. We also have data models for [Looker] [looker] in LookML

**For more information on the current Naked_Beer architecture, please see the [Technical architecture] [architecture-doc]**.
